	  Say Y here to enable the PCI Power Control driver to control the power
	  state of PCI slots.

	  This is a generic driver that controls the power state of different
	  PCI slots. The voltage regulators powering the rails of the PCI slots
	  are expected to be defined in the devicetree node of the PCI bridge.
