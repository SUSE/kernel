	  Support the RP1 peripheral chip found on Raspberry Pi 5 board.

	  This device supports several sub-devices including e.g. Ethernet
	  controller, USB controller, I2C, SPI and UART.

	  The driver is responsible for enabling the DT node once the PCIe
	  endpoint has been configured, and handling interrupts.

	  This driver uses an overlay to load other drivers to support for
	  RP1 internal sub-devices.
