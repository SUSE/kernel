	  If you say yes here you get support the RTC MFD driver for Sophgo
	  CV1800 series SoC. The RTC module comprises a 32kHz oscillator,
	  Power-on-Reset (PoR) sub-module, HW state machine to control chip
	  power-on, power-off and reset. Furthermore, the 8051 subsystem is
	  located within RTCSYS including associated SRAM block.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called cv1800-rtcsys.

	  This is the core driver for the Sophgo SG2044 TOP system
	  controller device. This driver provide PLL clock device
	  for the SoC.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called sg2044-topsys.
