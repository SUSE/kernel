	  Preload default EDID (Extended Display Identification Data)
	  branded by Linux Foundation that exposes display modes up
	  to 4k@30Hz, which have best compatibility with HDMI transmitters.

	  Enabling this option is recommended for a non-production use-cases.
	  It will make driver usable out-of-the-box.

	  For a higher display modes you will need to load customized EDID
	  from userspace using v4l2-ctl tool or by other means.

	  Without enabling this option driver will be practically
	  non-functional until EDID will be loaded from userspace.
	  Which is a wanted behavior when using this driver in a
	  commercial product that should utilize own branded EDID.
