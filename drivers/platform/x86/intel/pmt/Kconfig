	  The Intel Platform Monitoring Technology (PMT) class driver provides
	  the basic sysfs interface and file hierarchy used by PMT devices.

	  For more information, see:
	  <file:Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-intel_pmt>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel_pmt_class.

	help
	  The Intel Platform Monitory Technology (PMT) Telemetry driver provides
	  access to hardware telemetry metrics on devices that support the
	  feature.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called intel_pmt_telemetry.

	help
	  Enable this option to compile and run a suite of KUnit tests for the Intel
	  Platform Monitoring Technology (PMT) driver. These tests are designed to
	  validate the driver's functionality, error handling, and overall stability,
	  helping developers catch regressions and ensure code quality during changes.

	  This option is intended for development and testing environments. It is
	  recommended to disable it in production builds. To compile this driver as a
	  module, choose M here: the module will be called pmt-discovery-kunit.
