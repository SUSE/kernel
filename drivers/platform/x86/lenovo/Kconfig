	  This is a driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It adds
	  support for Fn-Fx key combinations, Bluetooth control, video
	  output switching, ThinkLight control, UltraBay eject and more.
	  For more information about this driver see
	  <file:Documentation/admin-guide/laptops/thinkpad-acpi.rst> and
	  <http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/> .

	  This driver was formerly known as ibm-acpi.

	  Extra functionality will be available if the rfkill (CONFIG_RFKILL)
	  and/or ALSA (CONFIG_SND) subsystems are available in the kernel.
	  Note that if you want ThinkPad-ACPI to be built-in instead of
	  modular, ALSA and rfkill will also have to be built-in.

	  If you have an IBM or Lenovo ThinkPad laptop, say Y or M here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_ALSA_SUPPORT
	bool "Console audio control ALSA interface"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	depends on SND
	depends on SND = y || THINKPAD_ACPI = SND
	default y
	help
	  Enables monitoring of the built-in console audio output control
	  (headphone and speakers), which is operated by the mute and (in
	  some ThinkPad models) volume hotkeys.

	  If this option is enabled, ThinkPad-ACPI will export an ALSA card
	  with a single read-only mixer control, which should be used for
	  on-screen-display feedback purposes by the Desktop Environment.

	  Optionally, the driver will also allow software control (the
	  ALSA mixer will be made read-write).  Please refer to the driver
	  documentation for details.

	  All IBM models have both volume and mute control.  Newer Lenovo
	  models only have mute control (the volume hotkeys are just normal
	  keys and volume control is done through the main HDA mixer).

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUGFACILITIES
	bool "Maintainer debug facilities"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	help
	  Enables extra stuff in the thinkpad-acpi which is completely useless
	  for normal use.  Read the driver source to find out what it does.

	  Say N here, unless you were told by a kernel maintainer to do
	  otherwise.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_DEBUG
	bool "Verbose debug mode"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	help
	  Enables extra debugging information, at the expense of a slightly
	  increase in driver size.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_UNSAFE_LEDS
	bool "Allow control of important LEDs (unsafe)"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	help
	  Overriding LED state on ThinkPads can mask important
	  firmware alerts (like critical battery condition), or misled
	  the user into damaging the hardware (undocking or ejecting
	  the bay while buses are still active), etc.

	  LED control on the ThinkPad is write-only (with very few
	  exceptions on very ancient models), which makes it
	  impossible to know beforehand if important information will
	  be lost when one changes LED state.

	  Users that know what they are doing can enable this option
	  and the driver will allow control of every LED, including
	  the ones on the dock stations.

	  Never enable this option on a distribution kernel.

	  Say N here, unless you are building a kernel for your own
	  use, and need to control the important firmware LEDs.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_VIDEO
	bool "Video output control support"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	help
	  Allows the thinkpad_acpi driver to provide an interface to control
	  the various video output ports.

	  This feature often won't work well, depending on ThinkPad model,
	  display state, video output devices in use, whether there is a X
	  server running, phase of the moon, and the current mood of
	  Schroedinger's cat.  If you can use X.org's RandR to control
	  your ThinkPad's video output ports instead of this feature,
	  don't think twice: do it and say N here to save memory and avoid
	  bad interactions with X.org.

	  NOTE: access to this feature is limited to processes with the
	  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability, to avoid local DoS issues in platforms
	  where it interacts badly with X.org.

	  If you are not sure, say Y here but do try to check if you could
	  be using X.org RandR instead.

config THINKPAD_ACPI_HOTKEY_POLL
	bool "Support NVRAM polling for hot keys"
	depends on THINKPAD_ACPI
	default y
	help
	  Some thinkpad models benefit from NVRAM polling to detect a few of
	  the hot key press events.  If you know your ThinkPad model does not
	  need to do NVRAM polling to support any of the hot keys you use,
	  unselecting this option will save about 1kB of memory.

	  ThinkPads T40 and newer, R52 and newer, and X31 and newer are
	  unlikely to need NVRAM polling in their latest BIOS versions.

	  NVRAM polling can detect at most the following keys: ThinkPad/Access
	  IBM, Zoom, Switch Display (fn+F7), ThinkLight, Volume up/down/mute,
	  Brightness up/down, Display Expand (fn+F8), Hibernate (fn+F12).

	  If you are not sure, say Y here.  The driver enables polling only if
	  it is strictly necessary to do so.

config THINKPAD_LMI

	select FW_ATTR_CLASS
