	  Select this option to enable the AMD Heterogeneous Core Hardware
	  Feedback Interface. If selected, hardware provides runtime thread
	  classification guidance to the operating system on the performance and
	  energy efficiency capabilities of each heterogeneous CPU core. These
	  capabilities may vary due to the inherent differences in the core types
	  and can also change as a result of variations in the operating
	  conditions of the system such as power and thermal limits.
