TODO:
- lots of checkpatch cleanup
- use kernel coding style
- refine the code and remove unused code
- Implement hardware acceleration for imageblit if image->depth > 1
- must be ported to the atomic kms framework in the drm subsystem (which will
  give you a basic fbdev driver for free)

Note:
- This driver will be removed from staging after the drm driver is ready
- The drm driver is getting ready at https://gitlab.com/sudipm/sm750/tree/sm750
