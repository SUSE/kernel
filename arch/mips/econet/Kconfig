		  The EN751221 family includes EN7512, RN7513, EN7521, EN7526.
		  They are based on single core MIPS 34Kc processors. To boot

		  MIPS_RAW_APPENDED_DTB=y, and a root filesystem.

		  The SmartFiber XP8421-B is a device based on the EN751221 SoC.
		  It has 512MB of memory and 256MB of NAND flash. This kernel

		  through XMODEM and booted from memory in the bootloader, or
		  it can be packed in tclinux.trx format and written to flash.
