The Linux kernel user's and administrator's guide
=================================================

The following is a collection of user-oriented documents that have been
added to the kernel over time.  There is, as yet, little overall order or
organization here â€” this material was not written to be a single, coherent
document!  With luck things will improve quickly over time.

General guides to kernel administration
---------------------------------------

This initial section contains overall information, including the README
file describing the kernel as a whole, documentation on kernel parameters,
etc.

A big part of the kernel's administrative interface is the /proc and sysfs
virtual filesystems; these documents describe how to interact with tem

Here is a set of documents aimed at users who are trying to track down
problems and bugs in particular.

Support for non-native binary formats.  Note that some of these
documents are ... old ...

Workload analysis
-----------------

This is the beginning of a section with information of interest to
application developers and system integrators doing analysis of the
Linux kernel for safety critical applications. Documents supporting
analysis of kernel interactions with applications, and key kernel
subsystems expectations will be found here.
