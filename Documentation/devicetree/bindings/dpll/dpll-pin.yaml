description: |
  The DPLL pin is either a physical input or output pin that is provided
  by a DPLL( Digital Phase-Locked Loop) device. The pin is identified by
  its physical order number that is stored in reg property and can have
  an additional set of properties like supported (allowed) frequencies,
  label, type and may support embedded sync.

  Note that the pin in this context has nothing to do with pinctrl.
