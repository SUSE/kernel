properties:
  compatible:
    const: nicera,d3323aa

  vdd-supply:
    description:
      Supply voltage (1.8 to 5.5 V).

  vout-clk-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      GPIO for clock and detection.
      After reset, the device signals with two falling edges on this pin that it
      is ready for configuration (within 1.2 s).
      During configuration, it is used as clock for data reading and writing (on
      data-gpios).
      After all this, when device is in operational mode, it signals on this pin
      for any detections.

  data-gpios:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      GPIO for data reading and writing. This is denoted "DO (SI)" in datasheet.
      During configuration, this pin is used for writing and reading
      configuration data (together with vout-clk-gpios as clock).
      After this, during operational mode, the device will output serial data on
      this GPIO.
