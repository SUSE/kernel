description:
  RTC hardware module present on S32G2/S32G3 SoCs is used as a wakeup source.
  It is not kept alive during system reset and it is not battery-powered.

      - description: Clock source for the RTC module. Can be selected between
          4 different clock sources using an integrated hardware mux.
          On S32G2/S32G3 SoCs, 'source0' is the SIRC clock (~32KHz) and it is
          available during standby and runtime. 'source1' is reserved and cannot
          be used. 'source2' is the FIRC clock and it is only available during
          runtime providing a better resolution (~48MHz). 'source3' is an external
          RTC clock source which can be additionally added in hardware.
