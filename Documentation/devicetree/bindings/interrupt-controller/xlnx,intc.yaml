title: Xilinx Interrupt Controller

description:
  The controller is a soft IP core that is configured at build time for the
  number of interrupts and the type of each interrupt. These details cannot
  be changed at run time.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: xlnx,xps-intc-1.00.a

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  clocks:
    maxItems: 1

  power-domains:
    maxItems: 1

  resets:
    maxItems: 1

  "#interrupt-cells":
    const: 2
    description:
      Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an interrupt source.
      The value shall be a minimum of 1. The Xilinx device trees typically
      use 2 but the 2nd value is not used.

  interrupt-controller: true

  interrupts:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Specifies the interrupt of the parent controller from which it is chained.

  xlnx,kind-of-intr:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      A 32 bit value specifying the interrupt type for each possible interrupt
      (1 = edge, 0 = level). The interrupt type typically comes in thru
      the device tree node of the interrupt generating device, but in this case
      the interrupt type is determined by the interrupt controller based on how
      it was implemented.

  xlnx,num-intr-inputs:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    minimum: 1
    maximum: 32
    description:
      Specifies the number of interrupts supported by the specific
      implementation of the controller.
