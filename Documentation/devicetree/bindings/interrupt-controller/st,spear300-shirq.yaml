description: |
  SPEAr3xx architecture includes shared/multiplexed irqs for certain set of
  devices. The multiplexor provides a single interrupt to parent interrupt
  controller (VIC) on behalf of a group of devices.

  There can be multiple groups available on SPEAr3xx variants but not exceeding
  4. The number of devices in a group can differ, further they may share same
  set of status/mask registers spanning across different bit masks. Also in some
  cases the group may not have enable or other registers. This makes software
  little complex.

  A single node in the device tree is used to describe the shared interrupt
  multiplexer (one node for all groups). A group in the interrupt controller
  shares config/control registers with other groups. For example, a 32-bit
  interrupt enable/disable config register can accommodate up to 4 interrupt
  groups.
