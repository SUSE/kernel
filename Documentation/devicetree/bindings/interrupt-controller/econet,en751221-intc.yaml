description:
  The EcoNet EN751221 Interrupt Controller is a simple interrupt controller
  designed for the MIPS 34Kc MT SMP processor with 2 VPEs. Each interrupt can
  be routed to either VPE but not both, so to support per-CPU interrupts, a
  secondary IRQ number is allocated to control masking/unmasking on VPE#1. For
  lack of a better term we call these "shadow interrupts". The assignment of
  shadow interrupts is defined by the SoC integrator when wiring the interrupt
  lines, so they are configurable in the device tree.

    description:
      An array of interrupt number pairs where each pair represents a shadow
      interrupt relationship. The first number in each pair is the primary IRQ,
      and the second is its shadow IRQ used for VPE#1 control. For example,
      <8 3> means IRQ 8 is shadowed by IRQ 3, so IRQ 3 cannot be mapped, but
      when VPE#1 requests IRQ 8, it will manipulate the IRQ 3 mask bit.
