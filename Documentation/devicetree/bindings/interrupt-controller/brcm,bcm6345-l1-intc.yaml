description: >
  This block is a first level interrupt controller that is typically connected
  directly to one of the HW INT lines on each CPU.

  Key elements of the hardware design include:

    - 32, 64 or 128 incoming level IRQ lines

    - Most onchip peripherals are wired directly to an L1 input

    - A separate instance of the register set for each CPU, allowing individual
      peripheral IRQs to be routed to any CPU

    - Contains one or more enable/status word pairs per CPU

    - No atomic set/clear operations

    - No polarity/level/edge settings

    - No FIFO or priority encoder logic; software is expected to read all
      2-4 status words to determine which IRQs are pending

  If multiple reg ranges and interrupt-parent entries are present on an SMP
  system, the driver will allow IRQ SMP affinity to be set up through the
  /proc/irq/ interface.  In the simplest possible configuration, only one
  reg range and one interrupt-parent is needed.

  The driver operates in native CPU endian by default, there is no support for
  specifying an alternative endianness.
