properties:
  address-bits:
    description:
      Specifies number of address bits required to address the device
      described by this node, e.g. size of the MAC address.
    default: 48
    const: 48

  local-mac-address:
    description:
      Specifies MAC address that was assigned to the network device described by
      the node containing this property.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint8-array
    minItems: 6
    maxItems: 6

  mac-address:
    description:
      Specifies the MAC address that was last used by the boot program. This
      property should be used in cases where the MAC address assigned to the
      device by the boot program is different from the
      local-mac-address property. This property shall be used only if the value
      differs from local-mac-address property value.

    minItems: 6
    maxItems: 6

  max-frame-size:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    description:
      Maximum transfer unit (IEEE defined MTU), rather than the
      maximum frame size (there\'s contradiction in the Devicetree
      Specification).
