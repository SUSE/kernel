description:
  This module is part of the ROHM BD96802 MFD device. For more details
  see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd96802-pmic.yaml.

  The regulator controller is represented as a sub-node of the PMIC node
  on the device tree.

  Regulator nodes should be named to buck1 and buck2.
