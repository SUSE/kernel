  The Morello architecture is an experimental extension to Armv8.2-A,
  which extends the AArch64 state with the principles proposed in
  version 7 of the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions
  (CHERI) ISA.

  ARM's Morello Platforms are built as a research project to explore
  capability architectures based on arm.
