description:
  Some clocks in TI SoC support the autoidle feature. These properties are
  applicable only if the clock supports autoidle feature. It assumes a register
  mapped clock which can be put to idle automatically by hardware based on
  usage and configuration bit setting. Autoidle clock is never an individual
  clock, it is always a derivative of some basic clock like a gate, divider, or
  fixed-factor.

properties:
  ti,autoidle-shift:

    default: 0

  ti,invert-autoidle-bit:
    type: boolean
    description:
      autoidle is enabled by setting the bit to 0
