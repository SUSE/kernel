description: >
  ILP clock (sometimes referred as "slow clock") on Broadcom BCM53573 devices
  using Cortex-A7 CPU.

  ILP's rate has to be calculated on runtime and it depends on ALP clock which
  has to be referenced.

  This clock is part of PMU (Power Management Unit), a Broadcom device handling
  power-related aspects. Its node must be sub-node of the PMU device.
