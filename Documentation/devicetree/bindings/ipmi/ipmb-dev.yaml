title: The Intelligent Platform Management Bus(IPMB) Device

description: |
  The IPMB is an I2C bus which provides interconnection between a Baseboard
  Management Controller(BMC) and chassis electronics. The BMC sends IPMI
  requests to intelligent controllers like Satellite Management Controller(MC)
  devices via IPMB and the device sends responses back to the BMC.
  This device uses an I2C slave device to send and receive IPMB messages,
  either on a BMC or other MC. A miscellaneous device provices a user space
  program to communicate with the kernel and the backend device. Some IPMB
  devices only support the I2C protocol and not the SMB protocol.
