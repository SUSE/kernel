title: Intel Service Layer Driver for Stratix10 SoC

description: >
  Intel Stratix10 SoC is composed of a 64 bit quad-core ARM Cortex A53 hard
  processor system (HPS) and Secure Device Manager (SDM). When the FPGA is
  configured from HPS, there needs to be a way for HPS to notify SDM the
  location and size of the configuration data. Then SDM will get the
  configuration data from that location and perform the FPGA configuration.

  To meet the whole system security needs and support virtual machine requesting
  communication with SDM, only the secure world of software (EL3, Exception
  Layer 3) can interface with SDM. All software entities running on other
  exception layers must channel through the EL3 software whenever it needs
  service from SDM.

  Intel Stratix10 service layer driver, running at privileged exception level
  (EL1, Exception Layer 1), interfaces with the service providers and provides
  the services for FPGA configuration, QSPI, Crypto and warm reset. Service layer
  driver also manages secure monitor call (SMC) to communicate with secure monitor
  code running in EL3.
