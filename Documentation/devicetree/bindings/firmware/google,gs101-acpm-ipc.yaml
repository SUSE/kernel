description: |
  ACPM (Alive Clock and Power Manager) is a firmware that operates on the
  APM (Active Power Management) module that handles overall power management
  activities. ACPM and masters regard each other as independent hardware
  component and communicate with each other using mailbox messages and
  shared memory.

  This binding is intended to define the interface the firmware implementing
  ACPM provides for OSPM in the device tree.
