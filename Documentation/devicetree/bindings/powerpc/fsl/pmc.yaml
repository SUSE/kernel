title: Power Management Controller

description: |
  The Power Management Controller in several MPC8xxx SoCs helps save power by
  controlling chip-wide low-power states as well as peripheral clock gating.

  Sleep of peripheral devices is configured by the `sleep` property, for
  example `sleep = <&pmc 0x00000030>`. Any cells after the &pmc phandle are
  called a sleep specifier.

  For "fsl,mpc8349-pmc", sleep specifiers consist of one cell.  For each bit that
  is set in the cell, the corresponding bit in SCCR will be saved and cleared
  on suspend, and restored on resume.  This sleep controller supports disabling
  and resuming devices at any time.

  For "fsl,mpc8536-pmc", sleep specifiers consist of three cells, the third of
  which will be ORed into PMCDR upon suspend, and cleared from PMCDR upon
  resume.  The first two cells are as described for fsl,mpc8548-pmc.  This
  sleep controller only supports disabling devices during system sleep, or
  permanently.

  For "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" or "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc", Sleep specifiers consist of one
  or two cells, the first of which will be ORed into DEVDISR (and the second
  into DEVDISR2, if present -- this cell should be zero or absent if the
  hardware does not have DEVDISR2) upon a request for permanent device
  disabling.  This sleep controller does not support configuring devices to
  disable during system sleep (unless supported by another compatible match),
  or dynamically.

      "fsl,mpc8349-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
      compatible.  "fsl,mpc8313-pmc" should also be listed for any chip
      whose PMC is compatible, and implies deep-sleep capability.

      "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
      compatible.  "fsl,mpc8536-pmc" should also be listed for any chip
      whose PMC is compatible, and implies deep-sleep capability.

      "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
      compatible; all statements below that apply to "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" also
      apply to "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc".

      Compatibility does not include bit assignments in SCCR/PMCDR/DEVDISR; these
      bit assignments are indicated via the sleep specifier in each device's
      sleep property.
