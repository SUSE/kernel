title: VIA/Wondermedia VT8500 Timer

description:
  This is the timer block that is a standalone part of the system power
  management controller on VIA/WonderMedia SoCs (VIA VT8500 and alike).
  The hardware has a single 32-bit counter running at 3 MHz and four match
  registers, each of which is associated with a dedicated match interrupt,
  and the first of which can also serve as the system watchdog (if the
  watchdog function is enabled, it will reset the system upon match instead
  of triggering its respective interrupt)

    items:
      - description: Channel 0 match. Note that if the watchdog function
          is enabled, this interrupt will not fire and the system will
          reboot instead once the counter reaches match register 0 value
