Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/ecs_fruX subdirectory
		pertains to the memory media ECS (Error Check Scrub) control
		feature, where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device
		registered with the EDAC device driver for the ECS feature.
		/ecs_fruX belongs to the media FRUs (Field Replaceable Unit)
		under the memory device.

		The sysfs ECS attr nodes are only present if the parent
		driver has implemented the corresponding attr callback
		function and provided the necessary operations to the EDAC
		device driver during registration.

Description:
		(RW) The log entry type of how the DDR5 ECS log is reported.

		- 0 - per DRAM.

		- 1 - per memory media FRU.

		- All other values are reserved.

Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) The mode of how the DDR5 ECS counts the errors.
		Error count is tracked based on two different modes
		selected by DDR5 ECS Control Feature - Codeword mode and
		Row Count mode. If the ECS is under Codeword mode, then
		the error count increments each time a codeword with check
		bit errors is detected. If the ECS is under Row Count mode,
		then the error counter increments each time a row with
		check bit errors is detected.

		- 0 - ECS counts rows in the memory media that have ECC errors.

		- 1 - ECS counts codewords with errors, specifically, it counts
		      the number of ECC-detected errors in the memory media.

		- All other values are reserved.

Description:
		(WO) ECS reset ECC counter.

		- 1 - reset ECC counter to the default value.

		- All other values are reserved.

What:		/sys/bus/edac/devices/<dev-name>/ecs_fruX/threshold
Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) DDR5 ECS threshold count per gigabits of memory cells.
		The ECS error count is subject to the ECS Threshold count
		per Gbit, which masks error counts less than the Threshold.

		Supported values are 256, 1024 and 4096.

		All other values are reserved.
