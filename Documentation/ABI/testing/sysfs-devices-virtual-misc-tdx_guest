Description:
		Value of a TDX measurement register (MR). MRNAME and HASH above
		are placeholders. The optional suffix :HASH is used for MRs
		that have associated hash algorithms. See below for a complete
		list of TDX MRs exposed via sysfs. Refer to Intel TDX Module
		ABI Specification for the definition of TDREPORT and the full
		list of TDX measurements.

		Intel TDX Module ABI Specification can be found at:

KernelVersion:	v6.16
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RW) RTMR[0123] - 4 Run-Time extendable Measurement Registers.
		Read from any of these returns the current value of the
		corresponding RTMR. Write extends the written buffer to the
		RTMR. All writes must start at offset 0 and be 48 bytes in
		size. Partial writes will result in EINVAL returned by the
		write() syscall.
