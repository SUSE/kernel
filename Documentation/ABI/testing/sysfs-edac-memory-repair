Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/mem_repairX subdirectory
		pertains to the memory media repair features control, such as
		PPR (Post Package Repair), memory sparing etc, where <dev-name>
		directory corresponds to a device registered with the EDAC
		device driver for the memory repair features.

		Post Package Repair is a maintenance operation requests the memory
		device to perform a repair operation on its media. It is a memory
		self-healing feature that fixes a failing memory location by
		replacing it with a spare row in a DRAM device. For example, a
		CXL memory device with DRAM components that support PPR features may
		implement PPR maintenance operations. DRAM components may support
		two types of PPR functions: hard PPR, for a permanent row repair, and
		soft PPR, for a temporary row repair. Soft PPR may be much faster
		than hard PPR, but the repair is lost with a power cycle.

		The sysfs attributes nodes for a repair feature are only
		present if the parent driver has implemented the corresponding
		attr callback function and provided the necessary operations
		to the EDAC device driver during registration.

		In some states of system configuration (e.g. before address
		decoders have been configured), memory devices (e.g. CXL)
		may not have an active mapping in the main host address
		physical address map. As such, the memory to repair must be
		identified by a device specific physical addressing scheme
		using a device physical address(DPA). The DPA and other control
		attributes to use will be presented in related error records.

Description:
		(RW) Read/Write Nibble mask of the memory to repair.
		Nibble mask identifies one or more nibbles in error on the
		memory bus that produced the error event. Nibble Mask bit 0
		shall be set if nibble 0 on the memory bus produced the
		event, etc. For example, CXL PPR and sparing, a nibble mask
		bit set to 1 indicates the request to perform repair
		operation in the specific device. All nibble mask bits set
		to 1 indicates the request to perform the operation in all
		devices. Eg. for CXL memory repair, the specific value of
		nibble mask to use will be provided in related error records.
		For more details, See nibble mask field in CXL spec ver 3.1,
		section 8.2.9.7.1.2 Table 8-103 soft PPR and section
		8.2.9.7.1.3 Table 8-104 hard PPR, section 8.2.9.7.1.4

		to use for a repair operation from the memory device via
		related error records and trace events, for eg. CXL DRAM
		and CXL general media error records in CXL memory devices.

Description:
		(RW) The control attributes for the memory to be repaired.
		The specific value of attributes to use depends on the
		portion of memory to repair and will be reported to the host
		in related error records and be available to userspace
		in trace events, such as CXL DRAM and CXL general media
		error records of CXL memory devices.

		When readng back these attributes, it returns the current
		value of memory requested to be repaired.

		bank_group - The bank group of the memory to repair.

		bank - The bank number of the memory to repair.

		rank - The rank of the memory to repair. Rank is defined as a
		set of memory devices on a channel that together execute a
		transaction.

		row - The row number of the memory to repair.

		column - The column number of the memory to repair.

		channel - The channel of the memory to repair. Channel is
		defined as an interface that can be independently accessed
		for a transaction.

		sub_channel - The subchannel of the memory to repair.

		The requirement to set these attributes varies based on the
		repair function. The attributes in sysfs are not present
		unless required for a repair function.

		For example, CXL spec ver 3.1, Section 8.2.9.7.1.2 Table 8-103
		soft PPR and Section 8.2.9.7.1.3 Table 8-104 hard PPR operations,
		these attributes are not required to set. CXL spec ver 3.1,
		Section 8.2.9.7.1.4 Table 8-105 memory sparing, these attributes
		are required to set based on memory sparing granularity.
