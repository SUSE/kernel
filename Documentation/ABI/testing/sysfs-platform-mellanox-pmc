Description:
		List of events supported by the counters in the specific block.
		It is used to extract the event number or ID associated with
		each event.

Description:
		Event monitored by corresponding counter. This is used to
		program or read back the event that should be or is currently
		being monitored by counter<N>.

Date:		Dec 2020
KernelVersion:	5.10
Contact:	"Shravan Kumar Ramani <shravankr@nvidia.com>"
Description:
		Counter value of the event being monitored. This is used to
		read the counter value of the event which was programmed using
		event<N>. This is also used to clear or reset the counter value
		by writing 0 to the counter sysfs.

Description:
		Start or stop counters. This is used to start the counters
		for monitoring the programmed events and also to stop the
		counters after the desired duration. Writing value 1 will
		start all the counters in the block, and writing 0 will
		stop all the counters together.

Description:
		Value of register. This is used to read or reset the registers
		where various performance statistics are counted for each block.
		Writing 0 to the sysfs will clear the counter, writing any other
		value is not allowed.

Description:
		Use a counter for counting cycles. This is used to repurpose/dedicate
		any of the counters in the block to counting cycles. Each counter is
		represented by a bit (bit 0 for counter0, bit1 for counter1 and so on)
		and setting the corresponding bit will reserve that specific counter
		for counting cycles and override the event<N> setting.
