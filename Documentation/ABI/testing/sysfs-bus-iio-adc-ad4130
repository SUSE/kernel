What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_voltage-voltage_filter_mode_available
KernelVersion:  6.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Reading returns a list with the possible filter modes.

		This ABI is only kept for backwards compatibility and the values
		returned are identical to filter_type_available attribute
		documented in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio. Please,
		use filter_type_available like ABI to provide filter options for
		new drivers.

What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX/in_voltageY-voltageZ_filter_mode
KernelVersion:  6.2
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		This ABI is only kept for backwards compatibility and the values
		returned are identical to in_voltageY-voltageZ_filter_type
		attribute documented in Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-iio.
		Please, use in_voltageY-voltageZ_filter_type for new drivers.
