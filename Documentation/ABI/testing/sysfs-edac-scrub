Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		The sysfs EDAC bus devices /<dev-name>/scrubX subdirectory
		belongs to an instance of memory scrub control feature,
		where <dev-name> directory corresponds to a device/memory
		region registered with the EDAC device driver for the
		scrub control feature.

		The sysfs scrub attr nodes are only present if the parent
		driver has implemented the corresponding attr callback
		function and provided the necessary operations to the EDAC
		device driver during registration.

Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) The base address of the memory region to be scrubbed
		for on-demand scrubbing. Setting address starts scrubbing.
		The size must be set before that.

		The readback addr value is non-zero if the requested
		on-demand scrubbing is in progress, zero otherwise.

What:		/sys/bus/edac/devices/<dev-name>/scrubX/current_cycle_duration
Date:		March 2025
KernelVersion:	6.15
Contact:	linux-edac@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RW) The current scrub cycle duration in seconds and must be
		within the supported range by the memory scrubber.

		Scrub has an overhead when running and that may want to be
		reduced by taking longer to do it.
