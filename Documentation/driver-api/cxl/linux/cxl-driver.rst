CXL Driver Operation
====================

The devices described in this section are present in ::

  /sys/bus/cxl/devices/
  /dev/cxl/

The :code:`cxl-cli` library, maintained as part of the NDTCL project, may
be used to script interactions with these devices.

Drivers
=======
The CXL driver is split into a number of drivers.

* cxl_core  - fundamental init interface and core object creation
* cxl_port  - initializes root and provides port enumeration interface.
* cxl_acpi  - initializes root decoders and interacts with ACPI data.
* cxl_p/mem - initializes memory devices
* cxl_pci   - uses cxl_port to enumates the actual fabric hierarchy.

Driver Devices
==============
Here is an example from a single-socket system with 4 host bridges. Two host
bridges have a single memory device attached, and the devices are interleaved
into a single memory region. The memory region has been converted to dax. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/
    dax_region0  decoder3.0  decoder6.0  mem0   port3
    decoder0.0   decoder4.0  decoder6.1  mem1   port4
    decoder1.0   decoder5.0  endpoint5   port1  region0
    decoder2.0   decoder5.1  endpoint6   port2  root0

     "region0" -> "dax_region0";
     "dax_region0" -> "dax0.0";
   }

For this section we'll explore the devices present in this configuration, but
we'll explore more configurations in-depth in example configurations below.

Base Devices
------------
Most devices in a CXL fabric are a `port` of some kind (because each
device mostly routes request from one device to the next, rather than
provide a direct service).

Root
~~~~
The `CXL Root` is logical object created by the `cxl_acpi` driver during
:code:`cxl_acpi_probe` - if the :code:`ACPI0017` `Compute Express Link
Root Object` Device Class is found.

The Root contains links to:

* `Host Bridge Ports` defined by CHBS in the :doc:`CEDT<../platform/acpi/cedt>`

* `Downstream Ports` typically connected to `Host Bridge Ports`.

* `Root Decoders` defined by CFMWS the :doc:`CEDT<../platform/acpi/cedt>`

::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/root0
    decoder0.0          dport0  dport5    port2  subsystem
    decoders_committed  dport1  modalias  port3  uevent
    devtype             dport4  port1     port4  uport

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/root0/devtype
    cxl_port

  # cat port1/devtype
    cxl_port

  # cat decoder0.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_root

The root is first `logical port` in the CXL fabric, as presented by the Linux
CXL driver.  The `CXL root` is a special type of `switch port`, in that it
only has downstream port connections.

Port
~~~~
A `port` object is better described as a `switch port`.  It may represent a
host bridge to the root or an actual switch port on a switch. A `switch port`
contains one or more decoders used to route memory requests downstream ports,
which may be connected to another `switch port` or an `endpoint port`.

::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/port1
    decoder1.0          dport0    driver     parent_dport  uport
    decoders_committed  dport113  endpoint5  subsystem
    devtype             dport2    modalias   uevent

  # cat devtype
    cxl_port

  # cat decoder1.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_switch

  # cat endpoint5/devtype
    cxl_port

CXL `Host Bridges` in the fabric are probed during :code:`cxl_acpi_probe` at
the time the `CXL Root` is probed.  The allows for the immediate logical
connection to between the root and host bridge.

* The root has a downstream port connection to a host bridge

* The host bridge has an upstream port connection to the root.

* The host bridge has one or more downstream port connections to switch
  or endpoint ports.

A `Host Bridge` is a special type of CXL `switch port`. It is explicitly
defined in the ACPI specification via `ACPI0016` ID.  `Host Bridge` ports
will be probed at `acpi_probe` time, while similar ports on an actual switch
will be probed later.  Otherwise, switch and host bridge ports look very
similar - the both contain switch decoders which route accesses between
upstream and downstream ports.

Endpoint
~~~~~~~~
An `endpoint` is a terminal port in the fabric.  This is a `logical device`,
and may be one of many `logical devices` presented by a memory device. It
is still considered a type of `port` in the fabric.

An `endpoint` contains `endpoint decoders` and the device's Coherent Device
Attribute Table (which describes the device's capabilities). ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/endpoint5
    CDAT        decoders_committed  modalias      uevent
    decoder5.0  devtype             parent_dport  uport
    decoder5.1  driver              subsystem

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/endpoint5/devtype
    cxl_port

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/endpoint5/decoder5.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_endpoint


Memory Device (memdev)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `memdev` is probed and added by the `cxl_pci` driver in :code:`cxl_pci_probe`
and is managed by the `cxl_mem` driver. It primarily provides the `IOCTL`
interface to a memory device, via :code:`/dev/cxl/memN`, and exposes various
device configuration data. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/mem0
    dev       firmware_version    payload_max  security   uevent
    driver    label_storage_size  pmem         serial
    firmware  numa_node           ram          subsystem

A Memory Device is a discrete base object that is not a port.  While the
physical device it belongs to may also host an `endpoint`, the relationship
between an `endpoint` and a `memdev` is not captured in sysfs.

Port Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In our example described above, there are four host bridges attached to the
root, and two of the host bridges have one endpoint attached.

     "port1" -> "endpoint5";
     "port3" -> "endpoint6";
   }

Decoders
--------
A `Decoder` is short for a CXL Host-Managed Device Memory (HDM) Decoder. It is
a device that routes accesses through the CXL fabric to an endpoint, and at
the endpoint translates a `Host Physical` to `Device Physical` Addressing.

The CXL 3.1 specification heavily implies that only endpoint decoders should
engage in translation of `Host Physical Address` to `Device Physical Address`.
::

  8.2.4.20 CXL HDM Decoder Capability Structure

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
  CXL Host Bridge and Upstream Switch Port Decode Flow

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
  Device Decode Logic

These notes imply that there are two logical groups of decoders.

* Routing Decoder - a decoder which routes accesses but does not translate
  addresses from HPA to DPA.

* Translating Decoder - a decoder which translates accesses from HPA to DPA
  for an endpoint to service.

The CXL drivers distinguish 3 decoder types: root, switch, and endpoint. Only
endpoint decoders are Translating Decoders, all others are Routing Decoders.

.. note:: PLATFORM VENDORS BE AWARE

   Linux makes a strong assumption that endpoint decoders are the only decoder
   in the fabric that actively translates HPA to DPA.  Linux assumes routing
   decoders pass the HPA unchanged to the next decoder in the fabric.

   It is therefore assumed that any given decoder in the fabric will have an
   address range that is a subset of its upstream port decoder. Any deviation
   from this scheme undefined per the specification.  Linux prioritizes
   spec-defined / architectural behavior.

Decoders may have one or more `Downstream Targets` if configured to interleave
memory accesses.  This will be presented in sysfs via the :code:`target_list`
parameter.

Root Decoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `Root Decoder` is logical construct of the physical address and interleave
configurations present in the CFMWS field of the :doc:`CEDT
<../platform/acpi/cedt>`.
Linux presents this information as a decoder present in the `CXL Root`.  We
consider this a `Root Decoder`, though technically it exists on the boundary
of the CXL specification and platform-specific CXL root implementations.

Linux considers these logical decoders a type of `Routing Decoder`, and is the
first decoder in the CXL fabric to receive a memory access from the platform's
memory controllers.

`Root Decoders` are created during :code:`cxl_acpi_probe`.  One root decoder
is created per CFMWS entry in the :doc:`CEDT <../platform/acpi/cedt>`.

The :code:`target_list` parameter is filled by the CFMWS target fields. Targets
of a root decoder are `Host Bridges`, which means interleave done at the root
decoder level is an `Inter-Host-Bridge Interleave`.

Only root decoders are capable of `Inter-Host-Bridge Interleave`.

Such interleaves must be configured by the platform and described in the ACPI
CEDT CFMWS, as the target CXL host bridge UIDs in the CFMWS must match the CXL
host bridge UIDs in the CHBS field of the :doc:`CEDT
<../platform/acpi/cedt>` and the UID field of CXL Host Bridges defined in
the :doc:`DSDT <../platform/acpi/dsdt>`.

Interleave settings in a root decoder describe how to interleave accesses among
the *immediate downstream targets*, not the entire interleave set.

The memory range described in the root decoder is used to

1) Create a memory region (:code:`region0` in this example), and

2) Associate the region with an IO Memory Resource (:code:`kernel/resource.c`)

::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.0/
    cap_pmem           devtype                 region0
    cap_ram            interleave_granularity  size
    cap_type2          interleave_ways         start
    cap_type3          locked                  subsystem
    create_ram_region  modalias                target_list
    delete_region      qos_class               uevent

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.0/region0/resource
    0xc050000000

The IO Memory Resource is created during early boot when the CFMWS region is
identified in the EFI Memory Map or E820 table (on x86).

Root decoders are defined as a separate devtype, but are also a type
of `Switch Decoder` due to having downstream targets. ::

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_root

Switch Decoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any non-root, translating decoder is considered a `Switch Decoder`, and will
present with the type :code:`cxl_decoder_switch`. Both `Host Bridge` and `CXL
Switch` (device) decoders are of type :code:`cxl_decoder_switch`. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder1.0/
    devtype                 locked    size       target_list
    interleave_granularity  modalias  start      target_type
    interleave_ways         region    subsystem  uevent

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder1.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_switch

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder1.0/region
    region0

A `Switch Decoder` has associations between a region defined by a root
decoder and downstream target ports.  Interleaving done within a switch decoder
is a multi-downstream-port interleave (or `Intra-Host-Bridge Interleave` for
host bridges).

Interleave settings in a switch decoder describe how to interleave accesses
among the *immediate downstream targets*, not the entire interleave set.

Switch decoders are created during :code:`cxl_switch_port_probe` in the
:code:`cxl_port` driver, and is created based on a PCI device's DVSEC
registers.

Switch decoder programming is validated during probe if the platform programs
them during boot (See `Auto Decoders` below), or on commit if programmed at
runtime (See `Runtime Programming` below).


Endpoint Decoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any decoder attached to a *terminal* point in the CXL fabric (`An Endpoint`) is
considered an `Endpoint Decoder`. Endpoint decoders are of type
:code:`cxl_decoder_endpoint`. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder5.0
    devtype                 locked    start
    dpa_resource            modalias  subsystem
    dpa_size                mode      target_type
    interleave_granularity  region    uevent
    interleave_ways         size

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder5.0/devtype
    cxl_decoder_endpoint

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder5.0/region
    region0

An `Endpoint Decoder` has an association with a region defined by a root
decoder and describes the device-local resource associated with this region.

Unlike root and switch decoders, endpoint decoders translate `Host Physical` to
`Device Physical` address ranges.  The interleave settings on an endpoint
therefore describe the entire *interleave set*.

`Device Physical Address` regions must be committed in-order. For example, the
DPA region starting at 0x80000000 cannot be committed before the DPA region
starting at 0x0.

As of Linux v6.15, Linux does not support *imbalanced* interleave setups, all
endpoints in an interleave set are expected to have the same interleave
settings (granularity and ways must be the same).

Endpoint decoders are created during :code:`cxl_endpoint_port_probe` in the
:code:`cxl_port` driver, and is created based on a PCI device's DVSEC registers.

Decoder Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In our example described above, there is one root decoder which routes memory
accesses over two host bridges.  Each host bridge has a decoder which routes
access to their singular endpoint targets.  Each endpoint has a decoder which
translates HPA to DPA and services the memory request.

The driver validates relationships between ports by decoder programming, so
we can think of decoders being related in a similarly hierarchical fashion to
ports.

   :alt: Digraph of hierarchical relationship between root, switch, and endpoint decoders.
   :caption: Diagraph of CXL root, switch, and endpoint decoders.

   digraph foo {
     "root0"    -> "decoder0.0";
     "decoder0.0" -> "decoder1.0";
     "decoder0.0" -> "decoder3.0";
     "decoder1.0" -> "decoder5.0";
     "decoder3.0" -> "decoder6.0";
   }

Regions
-------

Memory Region
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `Memory Region` is a logical construct that connects a set of CXL ports in
the fabric to an IO Memory Resource.  It is ultimately used to expose the memory
on these devices to the DAX subsystem via a `DAX Region`.

An example RAM region: ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/region0/
    access0      devtype                 modalias  subsystem  uuid
    access1      driver                  mode      target0
    commit       interleave_granularity  resource  target1
    dax_region0  interleave_ways         size      uevent

A memory region can be constructed during endpoint probe, if decoders were
programmed by BIOS/EFI (see `Auto Decoders`), or by creating a region manually
via a `Root Decoder`'s :code:`create_ram_region` or :code:`create_pmem_region`
interfaces.

The interleave settings in a `Memory Region` describe the configuration of the
`Interleave Set` - and are what can be expected to be seen in the endpoint
interleave settings.

.. kernel-render:: DOT
   :alt: Digraph of CXL memory region relationships between root and endpoint decoders.
   :caption: Regions are created based on root decoder configurations. Endpoint decoders
             must be programmed with the same interleave settings as the region.

   digraph foo {
     "root0"    -> "decoder0.0";
     "decoder0.0" -> "region0";
     "region0" -> "decoder5.0";
     "region0" -> "decoder6.0";
   }

DAX Region
~~~~~~~~~~
A `DAX Region` is used to convert a CXL `Memory Region` to a DAX device. A
DAX device may then be accessed directly via a file descriptor interface, or
converted to System RAM via the DAX kmem driver.  See the DAX driver section
for more details. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/dax_region0/
    dax0.0      devtype  modalias   uevent
    dax_region  driver   subsystem

Mailbox Interfaces
------------------
A mailbox command interface for each device is exposed in ::

  /dev/cxl/mem0
  /dev/cxl/mem1

These mailboxes may receive any specification-defined command. Raw commands
(custom commands) can only be sent to these interfaces if the build config
:code:`CXL_MEM_RAW_COMMANDS` is set.  This is considered a debug and/or
development interface, not an officially supported mechanism for creation
of vendor-specific commands (see the `fwctl` subsystem for that).

Decoder Programming
===================

Runtime Programming
-------------------
During probe, the only decoders *required* to be programmed are `Root Decoders`.
In reality, `Root Decoders` are a logical construct to describe the memory
region and interleave configuration at the host bridge level - as described
in the ACPI CEDT CFMWS.

All other `Switch` and `Endpoint` decoders may be programmed by the user
at runtime - if the platform supports such configurations.

This interaction is what creates a `Software Defined Memory` environment.

See the :code:`cxl-cli` documentation for more information about how to
configure CXL decoders at runtime.

Auto Decoders
-------------
Auto Decoders are decoders programmed by BIOS/EFI at boot time, and are
almost always locked (cannot be changed).  This is done by a platform
which may have a static configuration - or certain quirks which may prevent
dynamic runtime changes to the decoders (such as requiring additional
controller programming within the CPU complex outside the scope of CXL).

Auto Decoders are probed automatically as long as the devices and memory
regions they are associated with probe without issue.  When probing Auto
Decoders, the driver's primary responsibility is to ensure the fabric is
sane - as-if validating runtime programmed regions and decoders.

If Linux cannot validate auto-decoder configuration, the memory will not
be surfaced as a DAX device - and therefore not be exposed to the page
allocator - effectively stranding it.

Interleave
----------

The Linux CXL driver supports `Cross-Link First` interleave. This dictates
how interleave is programmed at each decoder step, as the driver validates
the relationships between a decoder and it's parent.

For example, in a `Cross-Link First` interleave setup with 16 endpoints
attached to 4 host bridges, linux expects the following ways/granularity
across the root, host bridge, and endpoints respectively.

.. flat-table:: 4x4 cross-link first interleave settings

  * - decoder
    - ways
    - granularity

  * - root
    - 4
    - 256

  * - host bridge
    - 4
    - 1024

  * - endpoint
    - 16
    - 256

At the root, every a given access will be routed to the
:code:`((HPA / 256) % 4)th` target host bridge. Within a host bridge, every
:code:`((HPA / 1024) % 4)th` target endpoint.  Each endpoint translates based
on the entire 16 device interleave set.

Unbalanced interleave sets are not supported - decoders at a similar point
in the hierarchy (e.g. all host bridge decoders) must have the same ways and
granularity configuration.

At Root
~~~~~~~
Root decoder interleave is defined by CFMWS field of the :doc:`CEDT
<../platform/acpi/cedt>`.  The CEDT may actually define multiple CFMWS
configurations to describe the same physical capacity, with the intent to allow
users to decide at runtime whether to online memory as interleaved or
non-interleaved. ::

             Subtable Type : 01 [CXL Fixed Memory Window Structure]
       Window base address : 0000000100000000
               Window size : 0000000100000000
  Interleave Members (2^n) : 00
     Interleave Arithmetic : 00
              First Target : 00000007

             Subtable Type : 01 [CXL Fixed Memory Window Structure]
       Window base address : 0000000200000000
               Window size : 0000000100000000
  Interleave Members (2^n) : 00
     Interleave Arithmetic : 00
              First Target : 00000006

             Subtable Type : 01 [CXL Fixed Memory Window Structure]
       Window base address : 0000000300000000
               Window size : 0000000200000000
  Interleave Members (2^n) : 01
     Interleave Arithmetic : 00
              First Target : 00000007
               Next Target : 00000006

In this example, the CFMWS defines two discrete non-interleaved 4GB regions
for each host bridge, and one interleaved 8GB region that targets both. This
would result in 3 root decoders presenting in the root. ::

  # ls /sys/bus/cxl/devices/root0/decoder*
    decoder0.0  decoder0.1  decoder0.2

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.0/target_list start size
    7
    0x100000000
    0x100000000

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.1/target_list start size
    6
    0x200000000
    0x100000000

  # cat /sys/bus/cxl/devices/decoder0.2/target_list start size
    7,6
    0x300000000
    0x200000000

These decoders are not runtime programmable.  They are used to generate a
`Memory Region` to bring this memory online with runtime programmed settings
at the `Switch` and `Endpoint` decoders.

At Host Bridge or Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`Host Bridge` and `Switch` decoders are programmable via the following fields:

- :code:`start` - the HPA region associated with the memory region
- :code:`size` - the size of the region
- :code:`target_list` - the list of downstream ports
- :code:`interleave_ways` - the number downstream ports to interleave across
- :code:`interleave_granularity` - the granularity to interleave at.

Linux expects the :code:`interleave_granularity` of switch decoders to be
derived from their upstream port connections. In `Cross-Link First` interleave
configurations, the :code:`interleave_granularity` of a decoder is equal to
:code:`parent_interleave_granularity * parent_interleave_ways`.

At Endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~
`Endpoint Decoders` are programmed similar to Host Bridge and Switch decoders,
with the exception that the ways and granularity are defined by the interleave
set (e.g. the interleave settings defined by the associated `Memory Region`).

- :code:`start` - the HPA region associated with the memory region
- :code:`size` - the size of the region
- :code:`interleave_ways` - the number endpoints in the interleave set
- :code:`interleave_granularity` - the granularity to interleave at.

These settings are used by endpoint decoders to *Translate* memory requests
from HPA to DPA.  This is why they must be aware of the entire interleave set.

Linux does not support unbalanced interleave configurations.  As a result, all
endpoints in an interleave set must have the same ways and granularity.
