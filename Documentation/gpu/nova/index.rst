nova-core
=========

The nova-core driver is the core driver for NVIDIA GPUs based on GSP. nova-core,
as the 1st level driver, provides an abstraction around the GPUs hard- and
firmware interfaces providing a common base for 2nd level drivers, such as the
vGPU manager VFIO driver and the nova-drm driver.
