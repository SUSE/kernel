//! Virtual memory.
//!
//! This module deals with managing a single VMA in the address space of a userspace process. Each
//! VMA corresponds to a region of memory that the userspace process can access, and the VMA lets
//! you control what happens when userspace reads or writes to that region of memory.
//!
//! The module has several different Rust types that all correspond to the C type called
//! `vm_area_struct`. The different structs represent what kind of access you have to the VMA, e.g.
//! [`VmaRef`] is used when you hold the mmap or vma read lock. Using the appropriate struct
//! ensures that you can't, for example, accidentally call a function that requires holding the
//! write lock when you only hold the read lock.
