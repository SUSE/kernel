	  GCC plugins are loadable modules that provide extra features to the
	  compiler. They are useful for runtime instrumentation and static analysis.

	  See Documentation/kbuild/gcc-plugins.rst for details.

config GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY
	bool "Generate some entropy during boot and runtime"
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will instrument some kernel code to
	  extract some entropy from both original and artificially created
	  program state.  This will help especially embedded systems where
	  there is little 'natural' source of entropy normally.  The cost
	  is some slowdown of the boot process (about 0.5%) and fork and
	  irq processing.

	  Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically
	  secure!

	  This plugin was ported from grsecurity/PaX. More information at:
