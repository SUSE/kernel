	  Monitor that real-time tasks do not sleep in a manner that may
	  cause undesirable latency.

	  If you are developing a real-time system and not entirely sure whether
	  the applications are designed correctly for real-time, you want to say
	  Y here.

	  Enabling this monitor may have performance impact (due to select
	  TRACE_IRQFLAGS). Therefore, you probably should say N for
	  production kernel.
